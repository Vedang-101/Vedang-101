### Hi! I am Vedang Rahurkar [he/him],

I am a computer engineer, a computer graphics enthusiast, and a passionate game developer. Throughout my educational course, I managed to work on multiple projects ranging in various computer domains, while at the same time following my love and passion for game development by understanding new game trends and implementing them in different game engines.<br>
Being a computer engineer, I love to understand the "under the hood" workings of various software and frameworks which can be inferred from the projects I work on. I believe that games can have a positive impact on the players playing them, thus, through my game development projects, I try to express my thoughts and ideas in an immersive environment and try my best to achieve this positive impact among those who are playing them.
